\title{Top level log-likelihood function that implements the single model sampling}
\usage{
single_model_ll(
  x,
  data,
  contaminant_prob = 0.02,
  architecture = "IST",
  min_rt = 0,
  max_rt = 1
)

  x,
  data,
  contaminant_prob = 0.02,
  architecture = "IST",
  min_rt = 0,
  max_rt = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named vector containing parameter values to test}

\item{data}{The data for a single subject for which the likelihood should be
calculated}

\item{contaminant_prob}{The probability used for contaminant process in the
modelling. A contaminant process is just a uniform random response in the
allowable time window.}

\item{architecture}{The name of the architecture model to implement}

\item{min_rt}{The smallest possible response time in the data}

\item{max_rt}{The largest possible response time in the data}
}
\value{
The log of the likelihood for the data under parameter values x

The log of the likelihood for the data under parameter values x
}
\description{
This function runs one of the possible architectures repeatedly, horrible,
uses a global variable for the selected model.

\section{The parameter vector}{


The vector x should contain the following elements:
A number of \eqn{\alpha}
values

\itemize{
\item \strong{A} - the start point variability
\item \strong{b^a} and \strong{b^r}, the thresholds to either accept or
reject the item.
\item \strong{t0} - the residual time, bounded above by the minimum
response time for the participant
\item 12 drift rates. For each attribute there are three stimulus levels.
For each of these 6 attribute levels there are two drift rates, one drift
rate to accept (\strong{v^a}) and one to reject (\strong{v^r})
}
